ocaml-alsa
==========

This package contains an OCaml interface for the ALSA library, otherwise known
as libasound2.

Prerequisites
-------------

- ocaml >= 3.0.6 (haven't tried earlier versions)
- libasound2 >= 1.0.14a (haven't tried earlier versions)
- findlib >= 0.8.1 (haven't tried earlier versions)
- dune >= 2.0

Compilation
-----------

```sh
dune build
```

This should build both the native and the byte-code version of the
extension library.

Installation

Via `dune` (for developers):
```sh
